# Parallel Programming Concepts
This repository contains a report outlining the
various parallel programming concepts used in 
modern day programming languages. For several 
languages, the report goes over what paradigms or
concepts the language supports and gives an example
of a typical parallel program written in that 
language. It explains which tasks the languages
are best suited for.

In this repository you will also find the example
programs written in various languages.
